    \frametitle{Abstract}
    
    This problem statement addresses the inefficiencies in traditional student result management methods, 
    which are often manual, error-prone, and time-consuming. These issues lead to inaccuracies and increased administrative workload. 
    The aim is to develop a Student Result Management System that automates data handling, grading, and reporting. 
    By creating a more efficient and accurate system, this project seeks to streamline result management and support better decision-making in educational institutions.
